# eth-valkyoth-primitives

Support crate for `eth`: core `no_std` Ethereum protocol primitives.

Most users should depend on the facade crate instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
eth = "0.10"
```

Crates.io: <https://crates.io/crates/eth>

This package is published separately so the `eth` workspace can keep small,
auditable crate boundaries. Treat it as a lower-level building block unless the
`eth` documentation explicitly says otherwise.

The `0.9.3` release keeps the primitive API stable and patch-bumps the codec
dependency range for the `0.10.0` fuzz-harness baseline. Use the facade crate
documentation for examples and compatibility guidance.
