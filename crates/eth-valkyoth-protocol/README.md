# eth-valkyoth-protocol

Support crate for `eth`: fork-aware `no_std` Ethereum protocol validation
state and transaction envelope shell classification.

Most users should depend on the facade crate instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
eth = "0.12"
```

Crates.io: <https://crates.io/crates/eth>

This package is published separately so the `eth` workspace can keep small,
auditable crate boundaries. Treat it as a lower-level building block unless the
`eth` documentation explicitly says otherwise.

The `0.12.0` release classifies EIP-2718 typed transaction envelopes and
decodes legacy transaction fields into an explicitly unvalidated model. It does
not validate signatures, recover senders, enforce chain binding, or imply fork
validity.
